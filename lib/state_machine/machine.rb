module StateMachine
  # Represents a state machine for a particular attribute.  State machines
  # consist of events and a set of transitions that define how the state
  # changes after a particular event is fired.
  # 
  # A state machine may not necessarily know all of the possible states for
  # an object since they can be any arbitrary value.  As a result, anything
  # that relies on a list of all possible states should keep in mind that if
  # a state has not been referenced *anywhere* in the state machine definition,
  # then it will *not* be a known state unless the +other_states+ helper is used.
  # 
  # == State values
  # 
  # While strings are the most common object type used for setting values on
  # the state of the machine, there are no restrictions on what can be used.
  # This means that symbols, integers, dates/times, etc. can all be used.
  # 
  # With string states:
  # 
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :initial => 'parked' do
  #       event :ignite do
  #         transition :to => 'idling', :from => 'parked'
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # With symbolic states:
  # 
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
  #       event :ignite do
  #         transition :to => :idling, :from => :parked
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # With time states:
  # 
  #   class Switch
  #     state_machine :activated_at
  #       before_transition :to => nil, :do => lambda {...}
  #       
  #       event :activate do
  #         transition :to => lambda {Time.now}
  #       end
  #       
  #       event :deactivate do
  #         transition :to => nil
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # == Callbacks
  # 
  # Callbacks are supported for hooking before and after every possible
  # transition in the machine.  Each callback is invoked in the order in which
  # it was defined.  See StateMachine::Machine#before_transition
  # and StateMachine::Machine#after_transition for documentation
  # on how to define new callbacks.
  # 
  # === Canceling callbacks
  # 
  # Callbacks can be canceled by throwing :halt at any point during the
  # callback.  For example,
  # 
  #   ...
  #   throw :halt
  #   ...
  # 
  # If a +before+ callback halts the chain, the associated transition and all
  # later callbacks are canceled.  If an +after+ callback halts the chain,
  # the later callbacks are canceled, but the transition is still successful.
  # 
  # *Note* that if a +before+ callback fails and the bang version of an event
  # was invoked, an exception will be raised instead of returning false.  For
  # example,
  # 
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine, :initial => 'parked' do
  #       before_transition :to => 'idling', :do => lambda {|vehicle| throw :halt}
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
  #   vehicle.park        # => false
  #   vehicle.park!       # => StateMachine::InvalidTransition: Cannot transition via :park from "idling"
  # 
  # == Observers
  # 
  # Observers, in the sense of external classes and *not* Ruby's Observable
  # mechanism, can hook into state machines as well.  Such observers use the
  # same callback api that's used internally.
  # 
  # Below are examples of defining observers for the following state machine:
  # 
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       event :ignite do
  #         transition :to => 'idling', :from => 'parked'
  #       end
  #       ...
  #     end
  #     ...
  #   end
  # 
  # Event/Transition behaviors:
  # 
  #   class VehicleObserver
  #     def self.before_park(vehicle, transition)
  #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to park... state is: #{transition.from}, state will be: #{transition.to}"
  #     end
  #     
  #     def self.after_park(vehicle, transition, result)
  #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to park... state was: #{transition.from}, state is: #{transition.to}"
  #     end
  #     
  #     def self.before_transition(vehicle, transition)
  #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to #{transition.event}... #{transition.attribute} is: #{transition.from}, #{transition.attribute} will be: #{transition.to}"
  #     end
  #     
  #     def self.after_transition(vehicle, transition, result)
  #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to #{transition.event}... #{transition.attribute} was: #{transition.from}, #{transition.attribute} is: #{transition.to}"
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   Vehicle.state_machine do
  #     before_transition :on => :park, :do => VehicleObserver.method(:before_park)
  #     before_transition VehicleObserver.method(:before_transition)
  #     
  #     after_transition :on => :park, :do => VehicleObserver.method(:after_park)
  #     after_transition VehicleObserver.method(:after_transition)
  #   end
  # 
  # One common callback is to record transitions for all models in the system
  # for auditing/debugging purposes.  Below is an example of an observer that
  # can easily automate this process for all models:
  # 
  #   class StateMachineObserver
  #     def self.before_transition(object, transition)
  #       Audit.log_transition(object.attributes)
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   [Vehicle, Switch, Project].each do |klass|
  #     klass.state_machines.each do |machine|
  #       machine.before_transition klass.method(:before_transition)
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # Additional observer-like behavior may be exposed by the various
  # integrations available.  See below for more information.
  # 
  # == Integrations
  # 
  # By default, state machines are library-agnostic, meaning that they work
  # on any Ruby class and have no external dependencies.  However, there are
  # certain libraries which expose additional behavior that can be taken
  # advantage of by state machines.
  # 
  # This library is built to work out of the box with a few popular Ruby
  # libraries that allow for additional behavior to provide a cleaner and
  # smoother experience.  This is especially the case for objects backed by a
  # database that may allow for transactions, persistent storage,
  # search/filters, callbacks, etc.
  # 
  # When a state machine is defined for classes using any of the above libraries,
  # it will try to automatically determine the integration to use (Agnostic,
  # ActiveRecord, DataMapper, or Sequel) based on the class definition.  To
  # see how each integration affects the machine's behavior, refer to all
  # constants defined under the StateMachine::Integrations namespace.

    # == Examples
    # 
    # With a static initial state:

    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine :initial => 'parked' do
    #       ...

    #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
    #   Vehicle.state_machines['state'].initial_state(vehicle)   # => "parked"
    # 
    # With a dynamic initial state:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     attr_accessor :force_idle
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.force_idle ? 'idling' : 'parked'} do
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #   
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
    #   
    #   vehicle.force_idle = true
    #   Vehicle.state_machines['state'].initial_state(vehicle)   # => "idling"
    #   
    #   vehicle.force_idle = false
    #   Vehicle.state_machines['state'].initial_state(vehicle)   # => "parked"
    def initial_state(object)
      @initial_state.is_a?(Proc) ? @initial_state.call(object) : @initial_state
    end
    
    # Defines additional states that are possible in the state machine, but
    # which are derived outside of any events/transitions or possibly
    # dynamically via a lambda block.  This allows the given states to be:
    # * Queried via instance-level predicates
    # * Included in GraphViz visualizations
    # * Used in :except_from and :except_to transition/callback conditionals
    # 
    # == Example
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine :initial => 'parked' do
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :to => 'idling', :from => 'parked'
    #       end
    #        
    #       other_states %w(stalled stopped)
    #     end
    #     
    #     def stop
    #       self.state = 'stopped'
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # In the above state machine, the known states would be:
    # * +idling+
    # * +parked+
    # * +stalled+
    # * +stopped+
    # 
    # Since +stalled+ and +stopped+ are not referenced in any transitions or
    # callbacks, they are explicitly defined.
    def other_states(*args)
      add_states(args.flatten)
    end
    
    # Defines an event for the machine.
    # 
    # == Instance methods
    # 
    # The following instance methods are generated when a new event is defined
    # (the "park" event is used as an example):
    # * <tt>can_park?</tt> - Checks whether the "park" event can be fired given the current state of the object.
    # * <tt>next_park_transition</tt> -  Gets the next transition that would be performed if the "park" event were to be fired now on the object or nil if no transitions can be performed.
    # * <tt>park(run_action = true)</tt> - Fires the "park" event, transitioning from the current state to the next valid state.
    # * <tt>park!(run_action = true)</tt> - Fires the "park" event, transitioning from the current state to the next valid state.  If the transition fails, then a StateMachine::InvalidTransition error will be raised.
    # 
    # == Defining transitions
    # 
    # +event+ requires a block which allows you to define the possible
    # transitions that can happen as a result of that event.  For example,
    # 
    #   event :park do
    #     transition :to => 'parked', :from => 'idle'
    #   end
    #   
    #   event :first_gear do
    #     transition :to => 'first_gear', :from => 'parked', :if => :seatbelt_on?
    #   end
    # 
    # See StateMachine::Event#transition for more information on
    # the possible options that can be passed in.
    # 
    # *Note* that this block is executed within the context of the actual event
    # object.  As a result, you will not be able to reference any class methods
    # on the model without referencing the class itself.  For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     def self.safe_states
    #       %w(parked idling stalled)
    #     end
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       event :park do
    #         transition :to => 'parked', :from => Vehicle.safe_states
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end 
    # 
    # == Example
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine do
    #       event :park do
    #         transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(first_gear reverse)
    #       end
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    def event(name, &block)
      name = name.to_s
      event = events[name] ||= Event.new(self, name)
      event.instance_eval(&block)
      add_states(event.known_states)
      
      event
    end
    
    # Creates a callback that will be invoked *before* a transition is
    # performed so long as the given configuration options match the transition.
    # Each part of the transition (event, to state, from state) must match in
    # order for the callback to get invoked.
    # 
    # Configuration options:
    # * +to+ - One or more states being transitioned to.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
    # * +from+ - One or more states being transitioned from.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
    # * +on+ - One or more events that fired the transition.  If none are specified, then all events will match.
    # * +except_to+ - One more states *not* being transitioned to
    # * +except_from+ - One or more states *not* being transitioned from
    # * +except_on+ - One or more events that *did not* fire the transition
    # * +do+ - The callback to invoke when a transition matches. This can be a method, proc or string.
    # * +if+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should occur (e.g. :if => :allow_callbacks, or :if => lambda {|user| user.signup_step > 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
    # * +unless+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should not occur (e.g. :unless => :skip_callbacks, or :unless => lambda {|user| user.signup_step <= 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
    # 
    # The +except+ group of options (+except_to+, +exception_from+, and
    # +except_on+) acts as the +unless+ equivalent of their counterparts (+to+,
    # +from+, and +on+, respectively)
    # 
    # == The callback
    # 
    # When defining additional configuration options, callbacks must be defined
    # in either the :do option or as a block.  For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine do
    #       before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :set_alarm
    #       before_transition :to => 'parked' do |vehicle, transition|
    #         vehicle.set_alarm
    #       end
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # === Accessing the transition
    # 
    # In addition to passing the object being transitioned, the actual
    # transition describing the context (e.g. event, from state, to state)
    # can be accessed as well.  This additional argument is only passed if the
    # callback allows for it.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     # Only specifies one parameter (the object being transitioned)
    #     before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.set_alarm}
    #     
    #     # Specifies 2 parameters (object being transitioned and actual transition)
    #     before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle, transition| vehicle.set_alarm(transition)}
    #   end
    # 
    # *Note* that the object in the callback will only be passed in as an
    # argument if callbacks are configured to *not* be bound to the object
    # involved.  This is the default and may change on a per-integration basis.
    # 
    # See StateMachine::Transition for more information about the
    # attributes available on the transition.

    # Below is an example of a class with one state machine and various types
    # of +before+ transitions defined for it:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine do
    #       # Before all transitions
    #       before_transition :update_dashboard
    #       
    #       # Before specific transition:
    #       before_transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(first_gear idling), :on => 'park', :do => :take_off_seatbelt
    #       
    #       # With conditional callback:
    #       before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :take_off_seatbelt, :if => :seatbelt_on?
    #       
    #       # Using :except counterparts:
    #       before_transition :except_to => 'stalled', :except_from => 'stalled', :except_on => 'crash', :do => :update_dashboard
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # As can be seen, any number of transitions can be created using various
    # combinations of configuration options.
    def before_transition(options = {}, &block)
      add_callback(:before, options.is_a?(Hash) ? options : {:do => options}, &block)
    end
    
    # Creates a callback that will be invoked *after* a transition is
    # performed, so long as the given configuration options match the transition.
    # Each part of the transition (event, to state, from state) must match
    # in order for the callback to get invoked.
    # 
    # Configuration options:
    # * +to+ - One or more states being transitioned to.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
    # * +from+ - One or more states being transitioned from.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
    # * +on+ - One or more events that fired the transition.  If none are specified, then all events will match.
    # * +except_to+ - One more states *not* being transitioned to
    # * +except_from+ - One or more states *not* being transitioned from
    # * +except_on+ - One or more events that *did not* fire the transition
    # * +do+ - The callback to invoke when a transition matches. This can be a method, proc or string.
    # * +if+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should occur (e.g. :if => :allow_callbacks, or :if => lambda {|user| user.signup_step > 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
    # * +unless+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should not occur (e.g. :unless => :skip_callbacks, or :unless => lambda {|user| user.signup_step <= 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
    # 
    # The +except+ group of options (+except_to+, +exception_from+, and
    # +except_on+) acts as the +unless+ equivalent of their counterparts (+to+,
    # +from+, and +on+, respectively)
    # 
    # == The callback
    # 
    # When defining additional configuration options, callbacks must be defined
    # in either the :do option or as a block.  For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine do
    #       after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :set_alarm
    #       after_transition :to => 'parked' do |vehicle, transition, result|
    #         vehicle.set_alarm
    #       end
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # === Accessing the transition / result
    # 
    # In addition to passing the object being transitioned, the actual
    # transition describing the context (e.g. event, from state, to state) and
    # the result from calling the object's action can be optionally passed as
    # well.  These additional arguments are only passed if the callback allows
    # for it.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     # Only specifies one parameter (the object being transitioned)
    #     after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.set_alarm}
    #     
    #     # Specifies 3 parameters (object being transitioned, transition, and action result)
    #     after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle, transition, result| vehicle.set_alarm(transition) if result}
    #   end
    # 
    # *Note* that the object in the callback will only be passed in as an
    # argument if callbacks are configured to *not* be bound to the object
    # involved.  This is the default and may change on a per-integration basis.
    # 
    # See StateMachine::Transition for more information about the
    # attributes available on the transition.
    # 
    # == Examples
    # 
    # Below is an example of a model with one state machine and various types
    # of +after+ transitions defined for it:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine do
    #       # After all transitions
    #       after_transition :update_dashboard
    #       
    #       # After specific transition:
    #       after_transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(first_gear idling), :on => 'park', :do => :take_off_seatbelt
    #       
    #       # With conditional callback:
    #       after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :take_off_seatbelt, :if => :seatbelt_on?
    #       
    #       # Using :except counterparts:
    #       after_transition :except_to => 'stalled', :except_from => 'stalled', :except_on => 'crash', :do => :update_dashboard
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # As can be seen, any number of transitions can be created using various
    # combinations of configuration options.

    #
