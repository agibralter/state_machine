module PluginAWeek #:nodoc:
  module StateMachine
    # Represents a state machine for a particular attribute.  State machines
    # consist of events and a set of transitions that define how the state
    # changes after a particular event is fired.
    # 
    # A state machine may not necessarily know all of the possible states for
    # an object since they can be any arbitrary value.  As a result, anything
    # that relies on a list of all possible states should keep in mind that if
    # a state has not been referenced *anywhere* in the state machine definition,
    # then it will *not* be a known state.
    # 
    # == Callbacks
    # 
    # Callbacks are supported for hooking before and after every possible
    # transition in the machine.  Each callback is invoked in the order in which
    # it was defined.  See PluginAWeek::StateMachine::Machine#before_transition
    # and PluginAWeek::StateMachine::Machine#after_transition for documentation
    # on how to define new callbacks.
    # 
    # === Canceling callbacks
    # 
    # Callbacks can be canceled by throwing :halt at any point during the
    # callback.  For example,
    # 
    #   ...
    #   throw :halt
    #   ...
    # 
    # If a +before+ callback halts the chain, the associated transition and all
    # later callbacks are canceled.  If an +after+ callback halts the chain,
    # the later callbacks are canceled, but the transition is still successful.
    # 
    # *Note* that if a +before+ callback fails and the bang version of an event
    # was invoked, an exception will be raised instead of returning false.  For
    # example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine, :initial => 'idling' do
    #       before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle| throw :halt}
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #   
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
    #   vehicle.park        # => false
    #   vehicle.park!       # => PluginAWeek::StateMachine::InvalidTransition: Cannot transition via :park from "idling"
    # 
    # == Observers
    # 
    # Observers, in the sense of external classes and *not* Ruby's Observable
    # mechanism, can hook into state machines as well.  Such observers use the
    # same callback api that's used internally.
    # 
    # Below are examples of defining observers for the following state machine:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     state_machine do
    #       event :park do
    #         transition :to => 'parked', :from => 'idling'
    #       end
    #       ...
    #     end
    #     ...
    #   end
    # 
    # Event/Transition behaviors:
    # 
    #   class VehicleObserver
    #     def self.before_park(vehicle, transition)
    #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to park... state is: #{transition.from}, state will be: #{transition.to}"
    #     end
    #     
    #     def self.after_park(vehicle, transition, result)
    #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to park... state was: #{transition.from}, state is: #{transition.to}"
    #     end
    #     
    #     def self.before_transition(vehicle, transition)
    #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to #{transition.event}... #{transition.attribute} is: #{transition.from}, #{transition.attribute} will be: #{transition.to}"
    #     end
    #     
    #     def self.after_transition(vehicle, transition, result)
    #       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to #{transition.event}... #{transition.attribute} was: #{transition.from}, #{transition.attribute} is: #{transition.to}"
    #     end
    #   end
    #   
    #   Vehicle.state_machine do
    #     before_transition :on => :park, :do => VehicleObserver.method(:before_park)
    #     before_transition VehicleObserver.method(:before_transition)
    #     
    #     after_transition :on => :park, :do => VehicleObserver.method(:after_park)
    #     after_transition VehicleObserver.method(:after_transition)
    #   end
    # 
    # One common callback is to record transitions for all models in the system
    # for auditing/debugging purposes.  Below is an example of an observer that
    # can easily automate this process for all models:
    # 
    #   class StateMachineObserver
    #     def self.before_transition(object, transition)
    #       Audit.log_transition(object.attributes)
    #     end
    #   end
    #   
    #   [Vehicle, Switch, Project].each do |klass|
    #     klass.state_machines.each do |machine|
    #       machine.before_transition klass.method(:before_transition)
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # Additional observer-like behavior may be exposed by the various
    # integrations available.  See below for more information.
    # 
    # == Integrations
    # 
    # By default, state machines are library-agnostic, meaning that they work
    # on any Ruby class and have no external dependencies.  However, there are
    # certain libraries which expose additional behavior that can be taken
    # advantage of by state machines.
    # 
    # This library is built to work out of the box with a few popular Ruby
    # libraries that allow for additional behavior to provide a cleaner and
    # smoother experience.  This is especially the case for objects backed by a
    # database that may allow for transactions, persistent storage,
    # search/filters, callbacks, etc.
    # 
    # When a state machine is defined for classes using any of the above libraries,
    # it will try to automatically determine the integration to use (Agnostic,
    # ActiveRecord, or DataMapper) based on the class definition.  To see how
    # each integration affects the machine's behavior, refer to all constants
    # defined under the PluginAWeek::StateMachine::Integrations namespace.

      # With dynamic initial state:
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     state_machine :initial => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.force_idle ? 'idling' : 'parked'} do

        @initial_state.is_a?(Proc) ? @initial_state.call(object) : @initial_state
      end
      
      # Gets a list of all of the states known to this state machine.  This will
      # look in two places for state names:
      # * Event transitions (:to, :from, :except_to, and :except_from options)
      # * Transition callbacks (:to, :from, :except_to, and :except_from options)
      # 
      # Each of the above sources will be used to compile a union of the known
      # states.
      def states
        @states ||=
          begin
            states = []
            states << @initial_state if @initial_state && !@initial_state.is_a?(Proc)

      # Defines additional states that are possible in the state machine, but
      # which are derived outside of any events/transitions or possibly
      # dynamically via Proc.  This allows the creation of state conditionals
      # which are not defined in the standard :to or :from structure.
      # 
      # == Example
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     state_machine :initial => 'parked' do
      #       event :ignite do
      #         transition :to => 'idling', :from => 'parked'
      #       end
      #        
      #       other_states %w(stalled stopped)
      #     end
      #     
      #     def stop
      #       self.state = 'stopped'
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # In the above state machine, the known states would be:
      # * +idling+
      # * +parked+
      # * +stalled+
      # * +stopped+
      # 
      # Since +stalled+ and +stopped+ are not referenced in any transitions or
      # callbacks, they are explicitly defined.
      def other_states(*args)
        @states = nil # Reset the cache
        @other_states |= args
      end
      
      # Defines an event for the machine.
      # 
      # == Instance methods
      # 
      # The following instance methods are generated when a new event is defined
      # (the "park" event is used as an example):
      # * <tt>can_park?</tt> - Checks whether the "park" event can be fired given the current state of the object.
      # * <tt>next_park_transition</tt> -  Gets the next transition that would be performed if the "park" event were to be fired now on the object or nil if no transitions can be performed.
      # * <tt>park(run_action = true)</tt> - Fires the "park" event, transitioning from the current state to the next valid state.
      # * <tt>park!(run_action = true)</tt> - Fires the "park" event, transitioning from the current state to the next valid state.  If the transition fails, then a PluginAWeek::StateMachine::InvalidTransition error will be raised.
      # 
      # == Defining transitions
      # 
      # +event+ requires a block which allows you to define the possible
      # transitions that can happen as a result of that event.  For example,
      # 
      #   event :park do
      #     transition :to => 'parked', :from => 'idle'
      #   end
      #   
      #   event :first_gear do
      #     transition :to => 'first_gear', :from => 'parked', :if => :seatbelt_on?
      #   end
      # 
      # See PluginAWeek::StateMachine::Event#transition for more information on
      # the possible options that can be passed in.
      # 
      # *Note* that this block is executed within the context of the actual event
      # object.  As a result, you will not be able to reference any class methods
      # on the model without referencing the class itself.  For example,
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     def self.safe_states
      #       %w(parked idling stalled)
      #     end
      #     
      #     state_machine do
      #       event :park do
      #         transition :to => 'parked', :from => Car.safe_states
      #       end
      #     end
      #   end 
      # 
      # == Example
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     state_machine do
      #       event :park do
      #         transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(first_gear reverse)
      #       end
      #       ...
      #     end
      #   end
      def event(name, &block)
        name = name.to_s
        event = events[name] ||= Event.new(self, name)
        event.instance_eval(&block)
        event
      end
      
      # Creates a callback that will be invoked *before* a transition is
      # performed so long as the given configuration options match the transition.
      # Each part of the transition (event, to state, from state) must match in
      # order for the callback to get invoked.
      # 
      # Configuration options:
      # * +to+ - One or more states being transitioned to.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
      # * +from+ - One or more states being transitioned from.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
      # * +on+ - One or more events that fired the transition.  If none are specified, then all events will match.
      # * +except_to+ - One more states *not* being transitioned to
      # * +except_from+ - One or more states *not* being transitioned from
      # * +except_on+ - One or more events that *did not* fire the transition
      # * +do+ - The callback to invoke when a transition matches. This can be a method, proc or string.
      # * +if+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should occur (e.g. :if => :allow_callbacks, or :if => lambda {|user| user.signup_step > 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
      # * +unless+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should not occur (e.g. :unless => :skip_callbacks, or :unless => lambda {|user| user.signup_step <= 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
      # 
      # The +except+ group of options (+except_to+, +exception_from+, and
      # +except_on+) acts as the +unless+ equivalent of their counterparts (+to+,
      # +from+, and +on+, respectively)
      # 
      # == The callback
      # 
      # When defining additional configuration options, callbacks must be defined
      # in either the :do option or as a block.  For example,
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     state_machine do
      #       before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :set_alarm
      #       before_transition :to => 'parked' do |vehicle, transition|
      #         vehicle.set_alarm
      #       end
      #       ...
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # === Accessing the transition
      # 
      # In addition to passing the object being transitioned, the actual
      # transition describing the context (e.g. event, from state, to state)
      # can be accessed as well.  This additional argument is only passed if the
      # callback allows for it.
      # 
      # For example,
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     # Only specifies one parameter (the object being transitioned)
      #     before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.set_alarm}
      #     
      #     # Specifies 2 parameters (object being transitioned and actual transition)
      #     before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle, transition| vehicle.set_alarm(transition)}
      #   end
      # 
      # *Note* that the object in the callback will only be passed in as an
      # argument if callbacks are configured to *not* be bound to the object
      # involved.  This is the default and may change on a per-integration basis.
      # 
      # See PluginAWeek::StateMachine::Transition for more information about the
      # attributes available on the transition.
      # 
      # == Examples
      # 
      # Below is an example of a class with one state machine and various types
      # of +before+ transitions defined for it:
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     state_machine do
      #       # Before all transitions
      #       before_transition :update_dashboard
      #       
      #       # Before specific transition:
      #       before_transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(first_gear idling), :on => 'park', :do => :take_off_seatbelt
      #       
      #       # With conditional callback:
      #       before_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :take_off_seatbelt, :if => :seatbelt_on?
      #       
      #       # Using :except counterparts:
      #       before_transition :except_to => 'stalled', :except_from => 'stalled', :except_on => 'crash', :do => :update_dashboard
      #       ...
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # As can be seen, any number of transitions can be created using various
      # combinations of configuration options.
      def before_transition(options = {}, &block)
        add_callback(:before, options.is_a?(Hash) ? options : {:do => options}, &block)
      end
      
      # Creates a callback that will be invoked *after* a transition is
      # performed, so long as the given configuration options match the transition.
      # Each part of the transition (event, to state, from state) must match
      # in order for the callback to get invoked.
      # 
      # Configuration options:
      # * +to+ - One or more states being transitioned to.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
      # * +from+ - One or more states being transitioned from.  If none are specified, then all states will match.
      # * +on+ - One or more events that fired the transition.  If none are specified, then all events will match.
      # * +except_to+ - One more states *not* being transitioned to
      # * +except_from+ - One or more states *not* being transitioned from
      # * +except_on+ - One or more events that *did not* fire the transition
      # * +do+ - The callback to invoke when a transition matches. This can be a method, proc or string.
      # * +if+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should occur (e.g. :if => :allow_callbacks, or :if => lambda {|user| user.signup_step > 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
      # * +unless+ - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the callback should not occur (e.g. :unless => :skip_callbacks, or :unless => lambda {|user| user.signup_step <= 2}). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value. 
      # 
      # The +except+ group of options (+except_to+, +exception_from+, and
      # +except_on+) acts as the +unless+ equivalent of their counterparts (+to+,
      # +from+, and +on+, respectively)
      # 
      # == The callback
      # 
      # When defining additional configuration options, callbacks must be defined
      # in either the :do option or as a block.  For example,
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     state_machine do
      #       after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :set_alarm
      #       after_transition :to => 'parked' do |vehicle, transition, result|
      #         vehicle.set_alarm
      #       end
      #       ...
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # === Accessing the transition / result
      # 
      # In addition to passing the object being transitioned, the actual
      # transition describing the context (e.g. event, from state, to state) and
      # the result from calling the object's action can be optionally passed as
      # well.  These additional arguments are only passed if the callback allows
      # for it.
      # 
      # For example,
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     # Only specifies one parameter (the object being transitioned)
      #     after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.set_alarm}
      #     
      #     # Specifies 3 parameters (object being transitioned, transition, and action result)
      #     after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle, transition, result| vehicle.set_alarm(transition) if result}
      #   end
      # 
      # *Note* that the object in the callback will only be passed in as an
      # argument if callbacks are configured to *not* be bound to the object
      # involved.  This is the default and may change on a per-integration basis.
      # 
      # See PluginAWeek::StateMachine::Transition for more information about the
      # attributes available on the transition.
      # 
      # == Examples
      # 
      # Below is an example of a model with one state machine and various types
      # of +after+ transitions defined for it:
      # 
      #   class Vehicle
      #     state_machine do
      #       # After all transitions
      #       after_transition :update_dashboard
      #       
      #       # After specific transition:
      #       after_transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(first_gear idling), :on => 'park', :do => :take_off_seatbelt
      #       
      #       # With conditional callback:
      #       after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => :take_off_seatbelt, :if => :seatbelt_on?
      #       
      #       # Using :except counterparts:
      #       after_transition :except_to => 'stalled', :except_from => 'stalled', :except_on => 'crash', :do => :update_dashboard
